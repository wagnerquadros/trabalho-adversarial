# Paper protocol

How the reported numbers of Jev IDS are produced, so that anyone with the repository, the raw NSL-KDD files and the API keys can produce
them again. Everything a run depends on is either committed here or written into the run's `config.json`.

This protocol moves k and holds the context fixed. [`docs/adversarial.md`](adversarial.md) is its mirror: it holds k fixed and moves the
context instead. A run of that study at the baseline context is a run of this protocol, byte for byte — same card, same split, same prompt
hashes — so the two sets of numbers compare as equals.

## Question

How well does Jev detect intrusions in NSL-KDD flow records as the number of labeled examples per category (k) grows, against an LLM, a
Random Forest and an unsupervised Isolation Forest, and at what cost and latency per flow.

A novel attack is a KDDTest+ flow whose attack name never occurs in KDDTrain+ (17 names, 3,750 flows); the detectors never see attack
names, only the five categories. Examples are drawn from the pool, k per category, nested across k within a seed and identical for every
detector (`run.sample_examples`).

## Runs

`make paper` runs the four targets below in sequence and then `make paper-summary`; each target can run alone, in its own terminal. Every
run writes `results/paper/<timestamp>-nsl-kdd-<detector>-paper/` with `config.json`, `predictions.jsonl` (one row per flow, k, seed and
repetition) and, for the API detectors, `responses.jsonl` (raw answers, not in git).

A quota error or a timeout is a row with `error`, not a crash, and an interrupted run keeps every row written so far.
`uv run jev-ids redo-errors results/paper/<run>` completes the run in place: the error rows are judged again and the flows never judged,
for the first time, each in its own cell and with the same examples; the pass is noted under `redone` in `config.json`.

k stops at 8: on 2026-09-22 the Jev run lost its k = 16 cells when the TypeSafe credits ran out, and the protocol was cut to k <= 8
for every detector instead of buying the cells back (`trimmed` in the two `config.json`). k = all means the whole pool; at k = all the seed changes nothing, and the three seeds are kept so that `compare` can pair the rows with
the other detectors' cells. The verdict of every detector is p_attack ≥ 0.5. A failed call becomes a row with `error` and no verdict,
counted as normal (fail-open) and as the lowest-ranked flow in the areas.

## Tables

```bash
uv run jev-ids metrics results/paper/*/ > results/paper/summary.csv
uv run jev-ids compare --a results/paper/<jev> --b results/paper/*llm-openai*
uv run jev-ids compare --a results/paper/<jev> --b results/paper/*llm-openai* --subset novel
uv run jev-ids compare --a results/paper/<jev> --b results/paper/<random_forest> --k-a 1 --k-b all
uv run jev-ids compare --a results/paper/<jev> --b results/paper/<isolation_forest> --k-a 0 --k-b all
```

`summary.csv` has one row per detector and k: F1, precision and recall of the attack class at the 0.5 cut, recall on novel and on known
attacks, recall and novel recall per category (`recall_dos`, `recall_novel_dos`, …), PR-AUC (average precision) and ROC-AUC of p_attack,
the error rate, the mean and sd of F1 over the seeds, mean tokens, list cost per 1M flows and mean latency. `compare` pairs two detectors
flow by flow within a cell, over as many run directories per side as they were run in, and reports the discordant pairs, who was right in them and McNemar's exact p; `--k-a`/`--k-b` pair across k,
which is how few-shot Jev meets the forests at k = all. Tables and figures are regenerated from `predictions.jsonl`; none is edited by hand.

## What the protocol does not fix

- Cost is tokens times list price, not what was billed. The GPT-5.6 calls went through a ChatGPT subscription and are priced at the public
  API rate; Jev is priced at TypeSafe's list rate.
- Latency is the wall clock around the successful HTTP call from the client, TypeSafe's API for Jev and the Codex backend for the LLM,
  without the failed attempts (`retries` counts them). The forests report the time of `predict_proba` or `score_samples` and the fit.
- Provider-side changes. Jev is pinned by the version the answer reports; GPT-5.6 only by its model id.

## Adding a detector

One module under `jev_ids/detectors/` and four lines elsewhere; the package docstring of `jev_ids/detectors/__init__.py` lists them. Then a
`paper-<name>` target above and, if it bills tokens, a `prices.json` entry.
