# Jev IDS

Intrusion detection on network flow records with a System One Model (Jev),
compared with an LLM baseline, a Random Forest and an Isolation Forest on data
efficiency, cost and latency. NSL-KDD is the first Dataset and NF-UQ-NIDS-v2
the second.

This fork adds the adversarial question: the paper moved k and held everything
else fixed, and a Sweep holds k fixed and moves the Context instead, to measure
how much of a Detector's accuracy comes from the wording around the Flow and
how far a Context that misinforms can push it.

## Language

### Data

**Dataset**:
A source of Flows prepared once into a Card, a Pool and Splits: NSL-KDD or
NF-UQ-NIDS-v2. Every Run names one.
_Avoid_: corpus, benchmark, source.

**Card**:
The description of a Dataset: its name, its features in column order, which of
them are symbolic, its Categories and which Category is benign.
_Avoid_: config, schema, manifest, metadata.

**Flow**:
One record of a Dataset: its features and its Category. In NSL-KDD, one
connection record with 41 attributes.
_Avoid_: row, line, record, connection.

**Category**:
The label every Detector works with, one per Flow, listed in the Card; one of
them is benign. NSL-KDD has `normal`, `dos`, `probe`, `r2l`, `u2r`. Attack
names such as `neptune` are never shown to a Detector.
_Avoid_: class, attack type (when the label is meant).

**Pool**:
The Flows of a Dataset that Examples are drawn from; KDDTrain+ in NSL-KDD.
k = all means the whole Pool.
_Avoid_: training set, train, corpus.

**Novel attack**:
An attack Flow whose kind is absent from the Pool. In NSL-KDD, a Flow whose
attack name occurs in KDDTest+ but never in KDDTrain+; seventeen such names
exist. In NF-UQ-NIDS-v2, a Flow of a Category held out of the Pool.
_Avoid_: unseen attack, zero-day, new attack.

**Example**:
A labeled Flow drawn from the Pool and shown to a Detector as a reference,
labeled by Category only.
_Avoid_: shot, demonstration, training row.

**k**:
The number of Examples per Category given to a Detector. k = 0 is zero-shot;
k = 4 with five Categories means twenty Examples.

**Split**:
A frozen, seeded sample of a Dataset's Flows outside the Pool, the Flows a Run
judges. In NSL-KDD, `internal` is for tuning, `paper` for reported results and
`smoke` for exercising the pipeline; these three are proportional, and `pilot`
is a further proportional sample used to rehearse the protocol and take design
decisions. `hard` and `mid` are diagnostic samples, half attacks and half
normals, of Flows inside a band of Difficulty. Splits are disjoint.

**Difficulty**:
NSL-KDD's per-record count of classic learners, out of 21, that classified the
record correctly. Low Difficulty means a hard Flow.

**Discordant pair**:
One Flow judged by two Detectors that gave different Verdicts. Only discordant
pairs tell two Detectors apart.
_Avoid_: subset, sample, test set.

### Context

**Context**:
Everything a Detector is shown around the Flow under test: the task
description, the column names, the Category descriptions, the shape of the
record, the labels on the Examples. One Run fixes one point of it.
_Avoid_: prompt (reserved for the file), input, setup.

**Factor**:
One dimension of the Context that can be moved on its own: `instructions`,
`columns`, `categories`, `record`, `labels`, `note`.
_Avoid_: variable, parameter, knob.

**Level**:
One value a Factor takes. The Levels of a Factor are ordered from the least
Context to the most, and the paper's Level is one of them.
_Avoid_: setting, option, variant.

**Ladder**:
The ordered Levels of a Factor, from least Context to most:
`instructions` goes none, minimal, paper, expert.
_Avoid_: scale, axis, range.

**Adversarial level**:
A Level outside the Ladder, which misinforms rather than informs: `misleading`
instructions, `shuffled` columns, `swapped` Category descriptions, `flipped`
and `benign` Example labels, and the `note` inside a record. It is measured,
never recommended.
_Avoid_: attack, poison, jailbreak.

**Sweep**:
One execution of the agent over the Context space: a sequence of Trials, each
an ordinary Run at one Level, written into one directory with the Trail.
_Avoid_: experiment, campaign, search.

**Trial**:
One Context level run and scored, with the paired comparison against the
baseline Trial. The first Trial of a Sweep is always the baseline.
_Avoid_: iteration, round, attempt.

**Trail**:
Every Trial of a Sweep in the order the agent ran them, with the score each
earned: `sweep.json` and `trials.csv`.
_Avoid_: log, history, record.

**Objective**:
Which way a better Trial moves the Detector's F1: `max` asks which Context
helps, `min` which Context hurts.
_Avoid_: goal, target, direction.

**Strategy**:
How the agent picks the next Trial: `ladder` measures every Level against the
baseline, `greedy` climbs from the best so far, `attack` has an LLM write the
next task description.
_Avoid_: policy, method, mode.

### Detection

**Detector**:
Anything that turns a Flow plus Examples into a Prediction: Jev, Laya, an LLM
baseline, the Random Forest or the Isolation Forest.
_Avoid_: model (reserved for a provider's model id), classifier, algorithm.

**Prediction**:
The output of one Detector for one Flow: Verdict, Category, p_attack,
confidence, and the latency and provider usage (tokens) measured for it.
_Avoid_: record, result, answer.

**Verdict**:
The binary decision for a Flow, `attack` or `normal`, taken as p_attack ≥ 0.5
for every Detector.
_Avoid_: label, prediction (when only the binary decision is meant).

**p_attack**:
The probability that a Flow is an attack, as returned by the Detector: Jev's
and Laya's `noul` answer, the number the LLM states, the Random Forest's class
probability, the Isolation Forest's anomaly score.
_Avoid_: score, confidence.

**confidence**:
Jev's per-question number for a `choice` question, derived from how spread out
the Category probabilities are. Only the Category question has one; `noul` has
none.
_Avoid_: certainty, probability.

**Batch (B)**:
The number of Flows judged in one request over a shared state. Fixed at 1 for
every Detector.

**Run**:
One execution of one Detector over one Split of one Dataset for a set of k
values, seeds and repetitions, at one Context level.
_Avoid_: experiment, job.

### Control loop

**Cascade**:
The three-zone control loop around Jev: block when p_attack ≥ τ_high, allow when
p_attack ≤ τ_low, escalate otherwise. Designed after the pilot.

**Escalation**:
Handing a Flow from the uncertain zone to the LLM agent for a second opinion.
