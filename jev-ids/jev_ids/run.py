"""One run: a Detector over one split, cell by cell, Flow by Flow.

In reading order:

- `RunSpec`: what the CLI resolved for one run.
- `load_prompt`: any prompt file as text plus its sha256; Jev, Laya and the LLMs load their files (`jev.json`, `llm.md`) through it alike.
- `build_detector` and `check_spec`: the Detector named in the spec, and the combinations of Detector, k and context that would only waste
  calls.
- `sample_examples`: k Examples per Category, seeded and nested across k.
- `execute` and `judge`: the loop itself, cell by cell and Flow by Flow, and the three files of the run.
- `run_from_spec`: the CLI entry that strings the above together.
- `redo_errors`: the other CLI entry, completing a run: its error rows are judged again and its missing Flows for the first time.

The loop runs k outermost, then seed, then rep, then every Flow of the split, so the prompt prefix stays constant for as long as possible
and provider prefix caches get their best chance. One request judges one Flow (B = 1). A call that fails ends as a row with `error`, never
as a crash, and the run goes on.

A run also fixes a point of the context space (`context.py`): the spec's `ContextSpec` renders the prompt file before the Detector is
built, relabels the Examples of each cell and rewrites the record of every Flow under test. At the baseline all three are the identity, so
a baseline run carries the paper's own `prompt_hash` and its rows are comparable with those of `results/paper/`.
