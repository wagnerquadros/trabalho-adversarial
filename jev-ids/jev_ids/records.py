"""The Prediction row and the three files of a run.

A Prediction is a plain dict, one line of `results/<run_id>/predictions.jsonl`.
In reading order:

- `complete_prediction`: joins what a Detector measured with what only the run loop knows (the cell, the Flow's truth, the Verdict, a
  request id and a timestamp) into one row.
- `write_config`, `append_prediction`, `read_predictions`: the run directory and its `config.json`, `predictions.jsonl` and
  `responses.jsonl`.

A Detector's dict holds only what it measured (`p_attack`, `category_pred`, `latency_ms`, `usage`, `error`, ...), so rows of different
Detectors carry different keys and a reader takes an optional key with `.get`. The key `raw`, the provider's whole answer, never reaches
predictions.jsonl: it goes to responses.jsonl, which git ignores.
