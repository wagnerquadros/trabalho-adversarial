"""The Isolation Forest baseline: anomaly detection fitted on benign traffic alone.

In reading order:

- `IsolationForestDetector`: `predict` fits one forest per cell on the benign Examples only, then scores one Flow with it.

The forest never sees an attack: it learns what normal traffic looks like and flags what is far from it, the classical anomaly-detection
setting of intrusion detection (Liu, Ting and Zhou, "Isolation Forest", ICDM 2008). A Detector that uses no labeled attack has no place on
the k axis, so it runs at k = all only and stands as a horizontal reference line, like the Random Forest at k = all. Flows are encoded
exactly as the Random Forest encodes them.

p_attack is the paper's anomaly score s: near 1 for a Flow that a few random cuts isolate, near 0 for one that takes as many cuts as the
deepest normal traffic, 0.5 for one that is no easier to isolate than average, which makes the shared 0.5 cut the paper's own threshold.
scikit-learn's `score_samples` returns -s ("the opposite of the anomaly score defined in the original paper"), so the sign is flipped here.
