"""Jev, TypeSafe's System One Model, through the official Python SDK.

In reading order:

- `JevDetector`: holds the request template of `prompts/<dataset>/jev.json` and the SDK client, built on the first call; `predict` judges
  one Flow per request.
- `request_body`: the template with the Flow and the Examples in its `state`.
- `attempt` and `post`: one request, retried when TypeSafe is rate-limited or overloaded; Laya (`laya.py`) retries through the same `post`.
- `measurements`: what one successful answer measured.

The template is the whole conversation with Jev: a `state` (the instructions, the column header, the Category descriptions) and two
questions that point at state paths in backticks. `is_attack` is a `noul` whose answer is a probability and becomes p_attack;
`category` is a `choice` over the Categories whose answer is the Category with a confidence. Python adds only what changes per call: the
Flow under test at `flows.under_test` and the labeled `examples`. One request judges one Flow (B = 1). The SDK sends the template's
`state`, `model` and `questions` exactly as the file has them, so the file still describes the request byte for byte.
