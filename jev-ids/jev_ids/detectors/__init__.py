"""Detectors: Jev, the two LLM baselines, the Random Forest and the Isolation Forest.

Each detector is a class with `name`, `model`, `prompt_hash` and `predict(flow, examples) -> dict` returning what it measured for that one
Flow (`p_attack`, `category_pred`, `latency_ms`, ...) or an `error`. The run loop treats them alike without a shared base class.

Adding a Detector takes one module here and four lines elsewhere. The module holds a class with those four members: `prompt_hash` is None
when it reads no prompt, and `model` is the key prices.json is priced by when the Detector bills tokens. Elsewhere: the class joins the
`Detector` union of `run.py`, `run.build_detector` gets a branch that constructs it from the spec and the card, the `--detector` help of
`cli.py` names it, and `run.check_spec` gets a guard if it treats k unlike the others. Whatever `predict` returns lands in the row as is
(`raw` and `probabilities` go to responses.jsonl instead), so a new measurement is a new key, and the metrics average every numeric
`usage` field they find.
