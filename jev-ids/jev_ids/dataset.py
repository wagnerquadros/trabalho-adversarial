"""Dataset access shared by every dataset: the card, the CSV shape and the Flow.

In reading order:

- `Flow`: one record of a dataset, as its CSV row has it.
- `load_config`: the card `dataset.json` as a dict, hashed.
- `flow_from_row` and `load_split`: a CSV in the shared shape as Flows.
- `split_header` and `write_split`: the same shape, written by the preparation scripts.

A dataset lives in `data/<name>/`: `dataset.json` (the card), `pool.csv` (the Flows that Examples are drawn from) and `splits/<split>.csv`
(the Flows a run judges). The card names the dataset, lists its `features` in column order, the `symbolic` ones among them, the `categories`
every Detector works with and which category is `benign`. Every CSV has `row_id`, one column per feature, `category` and `novel_attack`
(0/1); extra columns are ignored. Nothing here knows a dataset by name: `scripts/prepare_<name>.py` converts the raw download into this
shape, once, outside the package.

Vocabulary follows CONTEXT.md: a Flow is one record of the dataset; an Example is a pool Flow shown to a Detector as reference, a role and
not a separate type, so Examples are plain Flows here.
