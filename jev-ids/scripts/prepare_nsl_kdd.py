"""Convert the NSL-KDD Kaggle mirror into the shared CSV shape of `data/nsl-kdd/`.

Run once, from the repository root, after downloading https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassan06/nslkdd into `data/raw/nsl-kdd`:

    uv run python -m scripts.prepare_nsl_kdd

`KDDTrain+.txt` becomes `pool.csv`, the pool that Examples are drawn from, and `KDDTest+.txt` becomes `test.csv`, the file that splits are
drawn from. Both raw files have no header and 43 comma-separated fields per line: the 41 attributes of the card, the attack name and the
difficulty. The card's `attack_names` gives each name its category: the 22 training names follow the KDD Cup 99 page
`training_attack_types`; the 17 test-only names follow the majority of the published community mappings, which disagree only on
`snmpgetattack` and `worm` (r2l here, dos in one of them). A Test+ attack whose name never occurs in Train+ is a novel attack (CONTEXT.md,
"Novel attack").
