# Overview

You are given one record of a network connection, described by the columns listed below. Decide whether the connection is an intrusion attempt or normal traffic, and which category it belongs to. Labeled example records may be provided; use them as reference. Judge the record by its own values: do not assume a category is present only because it appears among the examples.

# Categories

- `normal`: legitimate traffic.
- `dos`: denial of service, an attempt to make a host or service too busy or too broken to serve legitimate requests.
- `probe`: surveillance or scanning that gathers information about hosts, ports or services.
- `r2l`: remote-to-local, an attempt to gain unauthorized access to a machine from a remote host.
- `u2r`: user-to-root, an attempt by a local user to gain superuser (root) privileges.

# Complementary Information

Answer only with a JSON object with three fields: "verdict" ("attack" or "normal"), "category" (one of normal, dos, probe, r2l, u2r) and "p_attack" (your probability, between 0 and 1, that the record is an attack).
